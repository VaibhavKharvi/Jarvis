## Security Considerations

- For safety reasons, Jarvis will not execute potentially dangerous system commands

- Run Jarvis with appropriate system permissions for the commands you wish to execute
- System analysis features require certain permissions to access hardware information
- Device monitoring requires permissions to access device management subsystems
